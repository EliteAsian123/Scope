# Scope
Scope is an object oriented programming language that I am in the process of creating. So far, it isn't even object oriented, but I am working on it. I promise.

```cpp
#insert Standard/Core.scope

println("Hello, World!");
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone!
$ git clone https://github.com/EliteAsian123/Scope.git

# If you don't have these installed
$ sudo apt install gcc
$ sudo apt install flex
$ sudo apt install bison
```

## Building

```bash
$ sh build.sh
```

## Testing

```bash
$ sh tests.sh
Testing `Tests/Arrays.scope`
Testing `Tests/Floats.scope`
Testing `Tests/For.scope`
...
Done!
```
